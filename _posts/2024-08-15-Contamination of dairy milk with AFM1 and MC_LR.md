Our paper about **"Contamination of dairy milk with AFM1 and MCLR and their synergistic interaction in inducing mitochondrial dysfunction"** is now online at Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal website.
 
In this work, an LC-MS/MS method for AFM1 and MC-LR quantification in dairy milk was developed and validated to analyze 113 dairy milk samples from Flanders, Belgium. Moreover, an in silico analysis, using a 3D molecular modeling was performed. Since AFM1 and MC-LR are hepatotoxic, their interaction in inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in HepG2 cells was investigated at low (subcytotoxic) concentrations.
