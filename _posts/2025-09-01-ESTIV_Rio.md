I am thrilled to be invited to speak on Introducing the hashtag#ESTIV Early Career Network (ECN) and Mentorship Program. 

The ESTIV Early Career Network (ECN), established in 2023/2024, is creating new opportunities for early career scientists in in vitro and in silico toxicology.

Beyond hosting a dedicated session at the ESTIV 2024 Congress, the ECN also supports the development of transferable skills essential for success in todayâ€™s scientific landscape.

ðŸ’¡ A highlight of these initiatives is the ESTIV ECN Mentorship Program, which will be introduced during WC13. In its first edition, early career researchers from academia and industry were matched with senior mentors across Europe based on shared professional interests.

ðŸ‘‰ The program is designed to:
- Foster meaningful engagement between mentors and mentees
- Provide expert guidance at crucial career stages
- Support personal and professional growth
- Encourage exploration of new opportunities while maintaining a healthy work-life balance

We look forward to presenting the programâ€™s structure and first outcomes at WC13 in Rio, with the aim of inspiring and empowering the next generation of scientists in next-generation risk assessment.
