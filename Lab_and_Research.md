## Research Interest
<!-- 
👉 Write a 2–3 paragraph summary of the overall research vision.
Focus on:
- Key toxins or contaminants studied (e.g., mycotoxins, cyanotoxins)
- Methods used (LC-MS/MS, in vitro models)
- The goal of linking food toxicology with human health.
-->

My research is centered on understanding the risks associated with natural toxins (mycotoxins and cyanotoxins) and other emerging contaminants in novel food.  
This is done by applying **LC-MS/MS** methods for detection. Also, through the use of _in vitro_ models, we investigate the effects of these toxins as mixtures on human health.  
This interdisciplinary approach bridges food toxicology and human health, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of complex challenges.
