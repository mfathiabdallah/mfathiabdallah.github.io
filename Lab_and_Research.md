## 🧬 Research Interest
My research is centered on understanding the risks associated with natural toxins (mycotoxins and cyanotoxins) and other emerging contaminants in novel food.  
This is done by applying **LC-MS/MS** methods for detection. Also, through the use of _in vitro_ models, we investigate the effects of these toxins as mixtures on human health.  
This interdisciplinary approach bridges food toxicology and human health, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of complex challenges.

We are open to support applications for scholarships and fellowships such as Marie Curie, DFF, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Villum Foundation, and other international funding opportunities.
