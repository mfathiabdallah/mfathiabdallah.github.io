#### Research Interest
My research is centered on understanding the risks associated with natural toxins (mycotoxins and cyanotoxins) and other emerging contaminants in novel food. This is done by applying LC-MS/MS methods for detection. Also, through the use of _in vitro_ models, we investigate the effects of these toxins as mixtures on human health.
This interdisciplinary approach bridges food toxicology and human health, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of complex challenges.
